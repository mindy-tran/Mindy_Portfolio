      <description> Clustering of ss-RNA seq data from the Sylwestrak Lab, isolated neuron populations Link to Written Report&#xA;Studied the impact of chronic morphine use on gene expression in the habenula and results suggest that there are cell populations within the habenula that impact mechanisms that drive addiction Implemented scripts in R to apply machine learning, hierarchical clustering, PCA, and statistical models to NGS sequencing data from the Emily Sylwestrak Lab to identify key genes in opioid-related neurons Analyzed high throughput single-cell RNA sequencing data from Drop-seq to study the genetic basis for neuropsychiatric disorders like addiction and depression </description>

      <description>Link to GitHub Repository&#xA;Images from the MNIST dataset Identified images in the MNIST dataset by implementing two deep feed-forward neural networks in PyTorch, treating the identification as a regression problem and a classification problem.&#xA;I compare the regression and classification models and provide summary statistics about their efficacy&#xA;For the regression-neural-network, evaluating on the training data showed a MAE of 0.5291415 and a MER of 0.3993. Evaluating on the testing data showed a MAE of 0.</description>

      <description>Link to GitHub Repository&#xA;Decision Tree Classification&#xA;Implemented a decision tree classifier from scratch Used the iris dataset to train and test my decision tree model. Assessed the accuracy of your technique using k-fold validation and created visualizations using my model. Results: The purple-colored species has a very consistent petal area and is distinct from the petal areas of the other two species. In comparison, as sepal area increases for the teal-colored species, the petal area also increases and can be less distinguishable from the yellow-colored species.</description>

      <title>Project 6: Agglomerative and Divisive Clustering on Paris Housing Data</title>

      <description>Link to GitHub Repository&#xA;In this project I apply two different hierarchical clustering algorithms (agglomerative and divisive) to cluster Paris housing data&#xA;Studied the categories of homes in Paris in an unsupervised way based on how big the house is (square footage) and the price. I wanted to determine how many distinct types of homes there are in Paris.&#xA;I determine that the Agglomerative algorithm I used was more “good” than the Divisive algorithm.</description>

      <description>Link to GitHub Repository&#xA;Constructed a linear model which predicts the age of an Abalone Processed Abalone data with over 41k data points. Constructed a linear model which predicts the age of an Abalone using SciKit-Learn, a popular library for data science Evaluated the model using the Mean Absolute Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error for the train and test data </description>
